## Hardware ##
I tested it with an esp8266 chip (esp-12e). Minimal scheme:  
![scheme](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/blob/master/images/scheme.png?raw=true)
 
At the first time in addition to scheme above IO0 (GPIO0) must be pulled down to GND at the boot and ESPHome can be uploaded through UART0. If your ESPHome configuration contains OTA you can pull up IO0 or leave it floating. All further updates can be uploaded over-the-air.  
I leave GPIO0 in air cause I don't see any reason to solder additional components for single use.

ESP-12E before DC-DC and air conditioner connected:  
![esp-12e minimal photo](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/blob/master/images/esp-12e.jpg?raw=true)
 
Air conditioner internal block has a 5-wire or a 4-wire (pseudo-USB) connection to the wifi-module. There are another types of connection too. For example AUX Aegean Sea ( 爱琴海 ), check [issue #71](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/issues/71) for details.

## 5-wire connection
It use [JST SM](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/pdf/eng/eSM.pdf) connector for 5-wire connection.

### Pinout ###
1. Yellow: +12V..+14V DC. Measured +14.70V max and +13.70V min. Service manual declares up to +16V.
2. Black: ground.
3. White: +5V DC (max: +5.63V; min: +4.43V) Enable signal for the 3V3 buck regulator on the OEM module. It goes directly to the air conditioner microcontroller through resistor 1kOhm. It's non used with the EPS module.
4. Blue: TX of air conditioner. High is +5V.
5. Red: RX of air conditioner. High is +5V.

You should feed your ESP **from +12V..+14V line only**! It is prohibited to use +5V line for this purpose.  
+5V line is digital signal line and directly goes to conditioner's controller. It can't provide enough power. In worst scenario you probably can burn down your air conditioner controller.

## 4-wire connection (pseudo-USB)
For 4-wire connection it is used USB-like connector. It is only physical USB but its pinout is UART with +12V..+14V power line.  

**ATTENTION!** It is incompatible with normal USB devices! Ordinary USB device like USB flash drive will be damaged if it will be plugged in air conditioner USB connector.  

**ATTENTION #2!** Manufacturer was changed power circuit and connector pinout in 2022-2023: power rail has +8.5V DC and TX/RX pins are swapped.

1. +12V..+14V DC before 2022-2023, +8.5V DC after 2022-2023. Service manual declares up to +16V.
2. RX of air conditioner before 2022-2023, TX for later modifications. High level is +5V.
3. TX of air conditioner before 2022-2023, RX for later modifications. High level is +5V.
4. GND - ground.

Big thanks to [@diabl0](https://github.com/diabl0) for this pinout in [issue #70](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/issues/70).  

If you are not sure, on which USB-pins do you have RX and TX lines, than don't afraid to connect it randomly. Neither air conditioner nor ESP will be damaged in this situation, just `aux_ac` can't receive data from the air conditioner. Swap TX and RX and your device will probably work.  

## Power supply

For power supply it is possible to use any kind of suitable modules. I use this:  
![power module](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/blob/master/images/DD4012SA.jpg?raw=true). 

## Connections ##
Black wire of AC's connector goes to the middle pin of the power module and to the GND pin of esp-12e.  
Yellow wire is connected to the Vin pin of the power module.  
Blue wire is connected to the RXD pin of esp-12e.  
Red wire is connected to the TXD pin of esp-12e.  

**ATTENTION!** In case you are using board like NodeMCU instead of clean esp8266/esp32 module, you shouldn't connect RX & TX wires of air conditioner to TX & RX pins of board! *(TXD1/RXD1, TXD2/RXD2 are also most likely not suitable.)* Use any other digital pins for UART connection. It doesn't matter if your board will use hardware or software UART. All UART types are working well.  
The usage of alternate pins for NodeMCU-like boards is necessary cause RX & TX lines of this boards are often have additional components like resistors or USB-TTL converters connected. This components are violate esp-to-ac UART connection.

All connections in custom 3d-printed case looks like this:

Since I didn't have JST SM connectors, I made my own:
![JST SM connector replica](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/blob/master/images/connector.JPG?raw=true).
 
It is made of standard 2.54mm pins and 3D-printed case.  
All models for 3D-printing are available too: [STL-files for connector](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/tree/master/enclosure/JST%20SM%20connector), [models of case parts](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component/tree/master/enclosure/case).
